Hi! I am Karan and I usually go by the handle `@mrkaran` on the interwebz. I work at [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com) where I focus mainly on Devops practices, Containers and Kubernetes. I've started my journey in DevOps fairly recently and prior to this I was a fullstack developer building web applications using Python, JS and Golang.
