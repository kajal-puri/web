Hi, I am Kajal Puri. I am a student pursuing Masters in Computer Science. My research interests are in the applications of Computer Vision, 3D Graphics and Machine Learning. 

I've spent the hot and humid summer of 2019 working at [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/pervasive/) with [Dr. James Crowley](http://www-prima.inrialpes.fr/Prima/Homepages/jlc/jlc.html), on the topic of Data Augmentation using GANs on Medical Imaging. Prior to that, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Fractal Analytics](https://fractal.ai/), second largest analytics tech company in India. As a member of R&D team, I gained my first experience handling large scale Computer Vision projects. I developed and worked on a bunch of problems ranging from Pose Estimation to predicting sales for big retail firms. 

I can offer scintillating conversations about Python (You can spot me in various PyCons across Europe) or Poetry (I try to read and write as much as possible) or Music (all genres except EDM and Metal) or Memes (ANY) or Movies (Please suggest me good movies that I haven't watched) or TV-Series (fantasy, sci-fi, thriller, sitcom, politics - I've seen it all) or just small talk, if and only if I like you.
